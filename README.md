## About Me

My journey into software engineering started back in middle school when my computer science professor called my work a "stroke of genius" all because I decided to use the marquee tag on images instead of text. That small moment of praise sparked my curiosity, pushing me to experiment, break my computer a million times, and ultimately, fall in love with coding.

Since then, I’ve been passionate about building and refining digital experiences. Throughout my career, I’ve worked with startups to build products from the ground up, enhance existing ones, and streamline engineering processes to drive innovation.
